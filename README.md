Welcome to the SMIT assignment repository for web layouts using HTML and CSS. This repository contains several web layout examples, each showcasing different techniques and approaches to create visually appealing and responsive web designs.

## Overview

## Layouts Included

### 1. Grid Template Method One Using Grid Area

- **File Name**: `grid-template-method-one.html`
- **Description**: This layout demonstrates the power of CSS Grid by utilizing the `grid-template-areas` property to define a complex grid layout with named areas. Each grid area corresponds to a specific section of the layout, allowing for easy organization and styling of content.
